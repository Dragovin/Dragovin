### ðŸ“‚ Projects

- My current "Project" is fixing an Xbox 360 Slim. Iâ€™ve got to research the ribbon cable responsible for turning it on/off and apply new thermal paste.
- One kinda cool thing Iâ€™ve done in the past is reset and bypass security measures on a phone someone found at work and had held onto for a while, and now I use it.
